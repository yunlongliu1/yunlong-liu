| June 2025 Core | Jun-Jul 17 | General quality focus | Confirmed |
| August 2025 Spam | Aug 26-Sep 22 | Targeted keyword stuffing, fake reviews, PBNs. Local Pack often stable | Confirmed |
| December 2025 Core | Dec 11-29 | Broad core update (rollout confirmed; "impact" is third-party interpretation — Google gave only generic guidance) | Dates confirmed |
| February 2026 Discover Update | Feb 5-27 | Discover-only; favored original/in-depth/local content, reduced clickbait | Dates confirmed |
| March 2026 Spam | Mar 24 (~19.5h) | Fast spam refresh; no local-specific guidance | Dates confirmed |
| March 2026 Core | Mar 27-Apr 8 | First core update of 2026 | Dates confirmed |

> **Note:** core-update *rollout dates* are Google-confirmed (Search Status Dashboard); the **"Impact" descriptions are third-party interpretation** — Google's only on-record statement for broad core updates is generic ("better surface relevant, satisfying content from all types of sites"). Do not present impact framing as Google fact.
