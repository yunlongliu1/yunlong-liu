# Local Schema Types & Industry-Specific Patterns (March 2026)

Schema is NOT a direct ranking factor (Confirmed: John Mueller, Gary Illyes). It indirectly impacts visibility through rich results (43% CTR increase, Webstix case study), better entity understanding, and AI search features.

## Industry-Specific Schema Patterns

### Restaurant
```
Restaurant (or specific subtype)
  + Menu > MenuSection > MenuItem (name, price, nutrition, suitableForDiet)
  + ReserveAction (booking capabilities; not a Google-supported rich result, machine-readable data only)
  + OrderAction (takeout/delivery; not a Google-supported rich result, machine-readable data only)
  + servesCuisine, acceptsReservations
```
Note: Google Food Ordering (GFO) direct checkout discontinued June 2024. "Order Online" button now redirects to third-party platforms.

### Healthcare
```
MedicalClinic (or Hospital, Dentist)
  + Physician pages: Person + medicalSpecialty + hospitalAffiliation + hasCredential
  + MedicalSpecialty (helps match "hip replacement surgery" to relevant pages)
  + sameAs: link to NPI Registry entry and medical board page
```
**HIPAA constraint**: Cannot confirm/deny reviewer is a patient in review responses. Fine precedent: $30,000 (Manasa Health Center, 2023).

### Legal
```
LegalService (NOT Attorney -- deprecated)
  + Person on attorney bio pages: jobTitle, worksFor, alumniOf, hasCredential (bar admissions)
  + makesOffer > Service (one per practice area)
  + Practitioner GBP: unique phone per attorney, not sole lawyer at firm
```
Note: Reviews follow practitioner listing when attorney changes firms.

### Home Services
```
Specific subtype (Plumber, Electrician, etc.)
  + areaServed: named cities with sameAs to Wikipedia/Wikidata
  + Service on individual service pages, linked via provider
  + hasOfferCatalog for service listings
```
**SAB note**: Service area in GBP does NOT currently impact rankings -- rankings based on verification address (Sterling Sky, March 2025).

### Real Estate
```
RealEstateAgent (for both agent and brokerage)
  + Person on agent pages: memberOf (brokerage), credentials
  + RealEstateListing + SingleFamilyResidence/Apartment + Offer (pricing)
  + Event for open houses with organizing agent
```
Note: No `RealEstateBrokerage` type exists on Schema.org.

### Automotive
```
AutoDealer (sales)
  + Car/Vehicle: VIN, mileage, fuelType, vehicleTransmission
  + Offer: price, priceCurrency, availability
  + Separate GBP: AutoRepair (service), AutoPartsStore (parts)
```
**VehicleListing deprecated June 12, 2025** (Confirmed). Use Car + Offer instead. Feed-based Vehicle Listings via Google Merchant Center still functional.

## Industry-Specific Citation Sources

### Restaurant
Yelp, TripAdvisor (1B+ reviews), OpenTable (DA + bookings), DoorDash, UberEats, Grubhub, Foursquare (powers Apple Maps, Uber)

### Healthcare
Healthgrades (50% of Americans who see a doctor visit), Zocdoc (booking + lead gen), WebMD physician directory (high DA), Vitals, Doximity (80% of US physicians), NPI Registry (entity verification source of truth), state medical board directories

Note: Internet Brands (KKR) owns Avvo + Martindale + Lawyers.com + Nolo. Thomson Reuters owns FindLaw + Super Lawyers + LawInfo.

### Home Services
Thumbtack ($400M revenue 2024, integrations with ChatGPT/Alexa/Zillow), BBB, Nextdoor, Yelp. **Declining**: Angi (revenue -30% from 2022 peak), Porch (pivoted to insurance), Houzz (pivoted to SaaS)

### Real Estate
Zillow (44% of all RE search traffic, integrated into ChatGPT Oct 2025), Homes.com (#2, overtook Realtor.com, 100M monthly visitors), Realtor.com, Redfin (acquired by Rocket Companies Mar 2025), local MLS sites

## Multi-Location Schema Pattern

```json
// Homepage: Organization with branchOf references
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "@id": "https://example.com/#org",
  "name": "Brand Name",
  "url": "https://example.com"
}

// Each location page: individual LocalBusiness
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Dentist",
  "@id": "https://example.com/locations/downtown/#location",
  "name": "Brand Name - Downtown",
  "branchOf": { "@id": "https://example.com/#org" },
  "address": { ... },
  "geo": { "latitude": "40.71234", "longitude": "-74.00567" },
  "telephone": "+1-555-123-4567",
  "openingHoursSpecification": [ ... ]
}
```

Use `@id` for unique identifiers per location. Subdirectory structure recommended: `domain.com/locations/city-name/` (subdirectory consolidates link equity better than subdomain, Bruce Clay study: 50%+ traffic lift).
