## How Google Search Works

Google Search operates in three stages: **Crawling** (Googlebot discovers pages by following links and reading sitemaps), **Indexing** (Google processes and stores page content, metadata, and signals in its search index), and **Serving** (when a user searches, Google's algorithms rank indexed pages by relevance, quality, and usability to return the most useful results). Pages must be crawlable and indexable to appear in search results.

---

## Google Search Essentials

Formerly known as "Webmaster Guidelines." Key requirements:

### Technical Requirements
- Pages must be accessible to Googlebot (not blocked by robots.txt or noindex)
- Pages must return HTTP 200 status for indexable content
- Content must be in a format Google can process (HTML preferred, JS-rendered content supported but slower)

### Spam Policies
- No cloaking (showing different content to Googlebot vs users)
- No doorway pages (pages created solely to rank for specific queries)
- No hidden text or links
- No keyword stuffing
- No link spam (buying links, excessive link exchanges)
- No scraped or auto-generated content without added value
- No sneaky redirects
- No thin affiliate pages

### Key Best Practices
- Create content for users, not search engines
- Make your site easy to navigate with a clear hierarchy
- Use descriptive, unique titles and meta descriptions per page
- Use heading tags (H1-H6) to structure content logically
- Optimize images with alt text and appropriate file sizes
- Ensure mobile-friendly responsive design
- Serve pages over HTTPS for security, trust, and a lightweight ranking signal
- Improve page load speed (Core Web Vitals)
- Submit an XML sitemap to Google Search Console
- Use structured data (JSON-LD) to help Google understand content

## Content Quality Signals

Google evaluates content quality through the E-E-A-T framework:

- **Experience**: Does the content creator have first-hand experience with the topic? (Original photos, personal stories, demonstrated use)
- **Expertise**: Does the creator have relevant knowledge or credentials? (Professional background, technical depth, accurate sourcing)
- **Authoritativeness**: Is the creator or site recognized as a go-to source? (Industry citations, brand mentions, expert recognition)
- **Trustworthiness**: Is the content and site reliable and transparent? (Contact info, secure site, editorial standards, accurate claims)

> **YMYL Note**: "Your Money or Your Life" topics (health, finance, safety, legal) are held to the highest E-E-A-T standards. Inaccurate YMYL content can cause real-world harm, so Google applies stricter quality thresholds.

> **Scope note**: E-E-A-T informs Google's core ranking and helpful-content systems broadly (not only YMYL), but Google never published a "December 2025 watershed" extending it to *all* competitive queries, nor per-industry traffic-drop figures — treat such claims as third-party interpretation, not Google fact.

## Core Web Vitals

Measured at the 75th percentile of real user data (field data).

| Metric | Good | Needs Improvement | Poor |
|--------|------|-------------------|------|
| **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint) | ≤ 2.5s | 2.5s – 4.0s | > 4.0s |
| **INP** (Interaction to Next Paint) | ≤ 200ms | 200ms – 500ms | > 500ms |
| **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift) | ≤ 0.1 | 0.1 – 0.25 | > 0.25 |

**Key facts:**
- INP replaced FID (First Input Delay) on March 12, 2024. FID was removed from Chrome's field-data tools (CrUX API, PageSpeed Insights) on September 9, 2024 (Lighthouse is a lab tool that never reported FID). Do NOT reference FID.
- Core Web Vitals are a confirmed ranking signal (since June 2021)
- Field data (CrUX) is preferred over lab data (Lighthouse) for assessment
- Passing all three metrics at "Good" is the target

**Measurement tools:**
- Google PageSpeed Insights (field + lab data)
- Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX): field data
- Lighthouse (lab data only)
- Google Search Console Core Web Vitals report

---

## Structured Data Best Practices

- **JSON-LD is Google's preferred format** (over Microdata and RDFa)
- Place JSON-LD in `<script type="application/ld+json">` tags in the `<head>` or `<body>`
- Always include `@context` and `@type` properties
- **Required properties** must be present for rich result eligibility
- **Recommended properties** improve rich result quality but aren't mandatory
- Only mark up content that is visible on the page
- Use Google's Rich Results Test to validate before deployment
- Do not mark up content that is misleading or hidden from users
- Keep schema current: update when page content changes

### Deprecated/Restricted Types (as of May 2026)
- **HowTo**: Rich results removed (September 2023)
- **FAQ**: Rich results retired for all sites (May 7, 2026). FAQPage remains a valid Schema.org type, but no AI or ranking benefit is confirmed.
- **SpecialAnnouncement**: Deprecated (July 31, 2025)
- **CourseInfo, EstimatedSalary, LearningVideo**: Retired (June 2025)
- **ClaimReview**: Retired (June 2025)
- **VehicleListing**: Retired (June 2025)

## Common Penalties & How to Avoid Them

### Manual Actions
Google Search Console notifications for violations. Common causes:
- **Unnatural links** (buying/selling links): Disavow bad links, request reconsideration
- **Thin content**: Add substantial unique value to affected pages
- **Cloaking/sneaky redirects**: Remove deceptive serving, request reconsideration
- **User-generated spam**: Moderate comments/forums, add nofollow to user links
- **Structured data issues**: Fix misleading or spam markup

### Algorithmic Demotions
No manual notification, detected through ranking drops. Common causes:
- **Helpful Content System**: Merged into Google's core ranking in March 2024: no longer a standalone system. Helpfulness signals are now evaluated within every core update. Low-value, AI-generated, or unhelpful content at scale still triggers demotions via core updates.
- **Core Updates**: Broad quality reassessment across all signals
- **Spam Updates**: Automated detection of spam patterns
- **Link Spam Updates**: Devaluation of manipulative link patterns

### Recovery Steps
1. Identify the issue (Search Console, ranking timeline analysis)
2. Fix the root cause (remove spam, improve content, clean links)
3. For manual actions: submit reconsideration request via Search Console
4. For algorithmic: improve quality, wait for next core update reassessment
5. Monitor recovery in Search Console performance reports

> **Mobile-first indexing** is the default for the indexed web and Googlebot Smartphone is the primary crawler (rollout completed 2024). A mobile version is not strictly required (Google says it is "very strongly recommended"); the real risk for desktop-only sites is content/parity loss, not hard exclusion.
