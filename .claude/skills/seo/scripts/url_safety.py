"""
Canonical URL safety module for claude-seo.

Centralizes SSRF protection, DNS rebinding mitigation, and DNS-pinned HTTP
fetching. Every script in this repository that accepts a user-supplied URL
MUST validate it through this module before issuing any network request.

Public API
==========

validate_url(url) -> bool
    Back-compat boolean check. Rejects non-http(s) schemes, missing
    hostnames, hard-blocked hostnames (localhost, cloud metadata
    endpoints), and IP literals that fall inside private/loopback/reserved
    ranges. Does NOT resolve DNS. Preserves the v1.9.9 contract used by
    google_auth.py.

validate_url_strict(url) -> tuple[str, str]
    Resolves the hostname via socket.getaddrinfo, validates every returned
    A record against the safety predicate, and returns
    ``(normalized_url, pinned_ipv4)``. Raises ``URLSafetyError`` if any
    resolved IP is non-public. Use this whenever the caller is about to
    open a network connection so DNS rebinding cannot swap a public IP
    for a private one between checks.

safe_requests_get(url, *, timeout=30, **kwargs) -> requests.Response
    ``requests.get(...)`` wrapped in a DNS-pinning context manager so the
    OS-level resolver only ever sees the pre-validated IP for the duration
    of the call. The original hostname is preserved in the HTTP Host
    header and TLS SNI; only the connect() target is forced to the pinned
    address.

safe_requests_head(url, *, timeout=30, **kwargs) -> requests.Response
    Same protection as ``safe_requests_get`` for callers that only need a
    HEAD preflight.

safe_requests_session(url) -> context manager yielding requests.Session
    Same protection as ``safe_requests_get`` for callers that need a
    session (cookies, redirect chains, multiple requests to one host).

is_safe_ip(ip_str) -> bool
    True iff the address parses as IPv4/IPv6 and is none of:
    private, loopback, reserved, link-local, multicast, unspecified.

URLSafetyError
    ValueError subclass raised by the strict validator and pinning helpers.

Threading
=========
The DNS pinning helper is a critical section guarded by a non-blocking
``threading.Lock``. Two concurrent pinned fetches on the same process will
raise rather than corrupt the global ``socket.getaddrinfo`` reference.
claude-seo scripts are intentionally single-threaded; parallelism is
delegated to the agent-process layer.

Limitations
===========
Playwright/Chromium-based fetches (``render_page.py``,
``capture_screenshot.py``) perform their own DNS resolution inside
Chromium and therefore cannot be DNS-pinned at the Python layer. Those
scripts must:

  1. Call ``validate_url_strict()`` as a pre-flight check, AND
  2. Attach a Playwright ``route()`` handler that re-validates each
     resolved request IP and aborts subresource fetches to private
     ranges.

The residual DNS-rebinding risk for browser-based fetches is documented
in SECURITY.md.
