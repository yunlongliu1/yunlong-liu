## The 6-Component Reasoning Brief

Every image prompt should contain these components, written as natural
narrative paragraphs, NEVER as comma-separated keyword lists.

### 1. Subject
The main focus of the image. Describe with physical specificity.

**Good:** "A weathered Japanese ceramicist in his 70s, deep sun-etched
wrinkles mapping decades of kiln work, calloused hands cradling a
freshly thrown tea bowl with an irregular, organic rim"

**Bad:** "old man, ceramic, bowl"

### 2. Action
What is happening. Movement, pose, gesture, state of being.

**Good:** "leaning forward with intense concentration, gently smoothing
the rim with a wet thumb, a thin trail of slip running down his wrist"

**Bad:** "making pottery"

### 3. Context
Environment, setting, temporal and spatial details.

**Good:** "inside a traditional wood-fired anagama kiln workshop,
stacked shelves of drying pots visible in the soft background, late
afternoon light filtering through rice paper screens"

**Bad:** "workshop, afternoon"

### 4. Composition
Camera angle, shot type, framing, spatial relationships.

**Good:** "intimate close-up shot from slightly below eye level,
shallow depth of field isolating the hands and bowl against the
soft bokeh of the workshop behind"

**Bad:** "close up"

### 5. Lighting
Light source, quality, direction, temperature, shadows.

**Good:** "warm directional light from a single high window camera-left,
creating gentle Rembrandt lighting on the face with a soft triangle
of light on the shadow-side cheek, deep warm shadows in the workshop"

**Bad:** "natural lighting"

### 6. Style
Art medium, aesthetic reference, technical photographic details.

**Good:** "captured with a Sony A7R IV, 85mm f/1.4 GM lens, Kodak Portra
400 color grading with lifted shadows and muted earth tones, reminiscent
of Dorothea Lange's documentary portraiture"

**Bad:** "photorealistic, 8K, masterpiece"

## Advanced Techniques

### Character Consistency (Multi-turn)
Use `gemini_chat` and maintain descriptive anchors:
- First turn: Generate character with exhaustive physical description
- Following turns: Reference "the same character" + repeat 2-3 key identifiers
- Key identifiers: hair color/style, distinctive clothing, facial feature

**Multi-image reference technique** (3.1 Flash):
- Provide up to 4-5 character reference images in the conversation
- Assign distinct names to each character ("Character A: the red-haired knight")
- Model preserves features across different angles, actions, and environments
- Works best when reference images show the character from multiple angles

### Style Transfer Without Reference Images
Describe the target style exhaustively instead of referencing an image:
```
Render this scene in the style of a 1950s travel poster: flat areas of
color in a limited palette of teal, coral, and cream. Bold geometric
shapes with visible paper texture. Hand-lettered title text with a
mid-century modern typeface feel.
```

### Text Rendering Tips
- Quote exact text: `with the text "OPEN DAILY" in bold condensed sans-serif`
- **25 characters or less**:this is the practical limit for reliable rendering
- **2-3 distinct phrases max**:more text fragments degrade quality
- Describe font characteristics, not font names
- Specify placement: "centered at the top third", "along the bottom edge"
- High contrast: light text on dark, or vice versa
- **Text-first hack:** Establish the text concept conversationally first ("I need a sign that says FRESH BREAD"), then generate. The model anchors on text mentioned early
- Expect creative font interpretations, not exact replication of described styles

### Positive Framing (No Negative Prompts)
Gemini does NOT support negative prompts. Rephrase exclusions:
- Instead of "no blur" → "sharp, in-focus, tack-sharp detail"
- Instead of "no people" → "empty, deserted, uninhabited"
- Instead of "no text" → "clean, uncluttered, text-free"
- Instead of "not dark" → "brightly lit, high-key lighting"

### Search-Grounded Generation
For images based on real-world data (weather, events, statistics),
Gemini can use Google Search grounding to incorporate live information.
Useful for infographics with current data.

**Three-part formula for search-grounded prompts:**
1. `[Source/Search request`:What to look up
2. `[Analytical task`:What to analyze or extract
3. `[Visual translation`:How to render it as an image

**Example:** "Search for the current top 5 programming languages by GitHub usage in 2026, analyze their relative popularity percentages, then generate a clean infographic bar chart with the language logos and percentages in a modern dark theme."

## Prompt Adaptation Rules

When adapting prompts from the claude-prompts database (Midjourney/DALL-E/etc.)
to Gemini's natural language format:

| Source Syntax | Gemini Equivalent |
|---------------|-------------------|
| `--ar 16:9` | Call `set_aspect_ratio("16:9")` separately |
| `--v 6`, `--style raw` | Remove - Gemini has no version/style flags |
| `--chaos 50` | Describe variety: "unexpected, surreal composition" |
| `--no trees` | Positive framing: "open clearing with no vegetation" |
| `(word:1.5)` weight | Descriptive emphasis: "prominently featuring [word]" |
| `8K, masterpiece, ultra-detailed` | Keep only "ultra-realistic, high resolution"; remove the rest |
| Comma-separated tags | Expand into descriptive narrative paragraphs |
| `shot on Hasselblad` | Keep - camera specs work well in Gemini |

## Common Prompt Mistakes

1. **Keyword stuffing**:stacking generic quality terms ("8K, masterpiece, best quality") adds nothing. Use only "ultra-realistic, high resolution" at the end
2. **Tag lists**:Gemini wants prose, not "red car, sunset, mountain, cinematic"
3. **Missing lighting**:The single biggest quality differentiator
4. **No composition direction**:Results in generic centered framing
5. **Vague style**:"make it look cool" vs specific art direction
6. **Ignoring aspect ratio**:Always set before generating
7. **Overlong prompts**:Diminishing returns past ~200 words; be precise, not verbose
8. **Text longer than ~25 characters**:Rendering degrades rapidly past this limit
9. **Burying key details at the end**:In long prompts, details placed last may be deprioritized; put critical specifics (exact text, key constraints) in the first third of the prompt
10. **Not iterating with follow-up prompts**:Use `gemini_chat` for progressive refinement instead of trying to get everything right in one generation

accents, paired with high-waisted athletic shorts and knee-high boots.
Captured mid-stride on a minimalist white runway, playful twinkle in her
eye, dramatic studio lighting from above.
```

### SaaS / Tech Marketing

**Pattern:** `[UI mockup or abstract visual] + "on [dark/light] background" + [specific colors with hex] + [typography description] + "clean, premium SaaS aesthetic" + [glassmorphism/gradient/glow effects]`

**Example (Dashboard Hero):**
```
A floating glassmorphism UI card on a deep charcoal background showing a
content analytics dashboard with a rising line graph in teal (#14B8A6),
bar charts in coral (#F97316), and a circular progress indicator at 94%.

label, surrounded by swirling gradient ribbons of teal and coral light.
The bottle sits on a reflective dark surface, sharp studio rim lighting
separating it from the background. Product photography for luxury
branding, high resolution, dramatic contrast.
```

### Key Tactics That Make Prompts Work

1. **Name real cameras**:"Sony A7R IV", "Canon EOS R5", "iPhone 16 Pro Max" anchor realism
2. **Specify exact lens**:"85mm f/1.4" gives the model precise depth-of-field information
3. **Use age + ethnicity + features**:"24yo with olive skin, hazel eyes" beats "a person"
4. **Name brands for styling**:"Lululemon mat", "Tom Ford suit" triggers specific visual associations
5. **Include micro-details**:"sweat droplets on collarbones", "baby hairs stuck to neck"
6. **Add platform context**:"Instagram aesthetic", "commercial photography for advertising"
7. **Describe textures**:"crinkle-textured", "metallic silver", "frosted glass"
8. **Use action verbs**:"mid-run", "posing confidently", "captured mid-stride"
9. **End with "ultra-realistic, high resolution"**:these two specific anchors help on Gemini. Avoid generic stacking like "8K, masterpiece, best quality" which adds no value
10. **For products, say "prominently displayed"**:ensures the product/logo isn't hidden

### Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

- **"A dark-themed Instagram ad showing..."**:too meta, describes the concept not the image
- **"A sleek SaaS dashboard visualization..."**:abstract, no visual anchors
- **"Modern, clean, professional..."**:vague adjectives that mean nothing to the model
- **"A bold call to action with..."**:describes marketing intent, not visual content
- **Describing what the viewer should feel**:instead, describe what creates that feeling

## Safety Filter Rephrase Strategies

Gemini's safety filters (Layer 2: server-side output filter) cannot be disabled.
When a prompt is blocked, the only path forward is rephrasing.

### Common Trigger Categories

| Category | Triggers on | Rephrase approach |
|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Violence/weapons | Combat, blood, injuries, firearms | Use metaphor or aftermath: "battle-worn" → "weathered veteran" |
| Medical/gore | Surgery, wounds, anatomical detail | Abstract or clinical: "open wound" → "medical illustration" |
| Real public figures | Named celebrities, politicians | Use archetypes: "Elon Musk" → "a tech entrepreneur in a minimalist office" |
| Children + risk | Minors in any ambiguous context | Add safety context: specify educational, family, or playful framing |
| NSFW/suggestive | Revealing clothing, intimate poses | Use artistic framing: "fashion editorial, fully clothed, editorial pose" |

### Rephrase Patterns

1. **Abstraction**:Replace specific dangerous elements with abstract concepts
2. **Artistic framing**:Frame content as art, editorial, or documentary
3. **Metaphor**:Use symbolic language instead of literal descriptions
4. **Positive emphasis**:Describe what IS present, not what's dangerous
5. **Context shift**:Move from threatening to educational/professional context

### Example Rephrases

| Blocked prompt | Successful rephrase |
|----------------|---------------------|
| "a soldier in combat firing a rifle" | "a determined soldier standing guard at dawn, rifle slung over shoulder, morning mist over the outpost" |
| "a scary horror monster" | "a fantastical creature from a dark fairy tale, intricate organic textures, bioluminescent accents, concept art style" |
| "dog in a fight" | "a friendly golden retriever playing energetically in a sunny park, action shot, joyful expression" |
| "medical surgery scene" | "a clean modern operating room viewed from the observation gallery, soft blue surgical lights, professional documentary style" |
| "celebrity portrait of [name]" | "a distinguished middle-aged man in a tailored navy suit, warm studio lighting, editorial portrait style" |

### Key Principle

Layer 2 (output filter) analyzes the generated image, not just the prompt.
Even well-phrased prompts can be blocked if the model's interpretation triggers
the output filter. When this happens, try shifting the visual concept further
from the trigger rather than just changing words.
