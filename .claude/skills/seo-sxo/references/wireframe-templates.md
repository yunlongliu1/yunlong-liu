# Wireframe Templates: IST/SOLL Patterns

Generate before (IST) and after (SOLL) wireframes showing what the page currently
looks like vs what it should look like based on SERP expectations.

## Core Principles

1. **Ultra-concrete placeholders**: Not "add CTA" but "add pricing CTA with annual
   savings badge below hero, linking to /pricing#enterprise"
2. **Mobile-first**: Assume 375px viewport first; above-the-fold (~600px) must
   contain the most critical element for the page type
3. **Semantic HTML**: Output as section outline with HTML5 elements

## IST Generation

Parse the current page and map to this structure:

```
IST: [URL]
├── ABOVE FOLD
│   ├── [element]: "[actual content]"
│   └── [element]: "[actual content]"
├── MAIN CONTENT
│   ├── [section]: "[summary]" (~XXX words)
│   └── [section]: "[summary]" (~XXX words)
├── SUPPORTING
│   └── [element]: "[description]"
└── FOOTER — [elements present]

Missing from SERP expectations:
- [element]: [why it matters]
```

## Placeholder Rules

When filling SOLL placeholders, always be specific:

| Bad (vague) | Good (concrete) |
|-------------|-----------------|
| "Add a CTA" | "Add 'Start Free Trial' button below hero, green #2d6a4f, links to /signup" |
| "Include social proof" | "Add 3 logos (G2, Capterra, TrustRadius) + '4.8/5 from 2,300 reviews'" |
| "Add FAQ section" | "Add 5 FAQs from PAA: 'Is X safe?', 'How much does X cost?', ..." |
| "Improve trust" | "Add SSL badge + 'SOC 2 certified' banner + customer count" |
| "More content" | "Add 400-word section under H2 'How [Feature] Works' with diagram" |
